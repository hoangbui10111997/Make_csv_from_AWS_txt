Depreciate assets over a longer timeframe,5. Gain greater control of data center security,"2. Increase speed and agility, 3. Stop guessing about capacity","Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. when you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice
In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower
Cloud is based on an operational expenditure (OPEX) model, not a capital expenditure (CAPEX) model
Cloud does not provide the ability to depreciate assets over a longer timeframe as you generally do not own the assets
Though the AWS cloud does provide significant security standards for the data center, you do not get more control as this is an AWS responsibility"

"When designing a VPC, what is the purpose of an Internet Gateway?",1. Provides Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets,2. Enables Internet communications for instances in public subnets,3. It's a bastion host for inbound management connections,4. It's used for making VPN connections to a VPC,,2. Enables Internet communications for instances in public subnets,"An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available vpc component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It therefore imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic
An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses
You cannot use an Internet Gateway as a bastion host, deploy an EC2 instance in a public subnet for this purpose
You cannot connect instances in a private subnet to the Internet using an Internet Gateway, you  need a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for this purpose
You cannot use the Internet Gateway for making VPN connections to a VPC, you need a Virtual Private Gateway for this purpose"

Security group rules configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS, 4. A public IP address assigned to the instance","To connect to a web page on a web server you use the http/https protocol. you therefore need to ensure the instance's security group allows these protocols in an inbound rule
A public IP address assigned to an instance in a public subnet is required in order to be able to directly access the instance from the Internet. There also needs to be an Internet Gateway attached to the VPC and an entry in the route table for the subnet that points to it
A private IP address will always be assigned to instances in EC2, but these do not enable access from the Internet
An established VPN connection is not required, connections will come through an Internet Gateway to a public subnet"
