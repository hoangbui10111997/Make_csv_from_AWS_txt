Question 17
Which of the statements below is accurate regarding Amazon S3 buckets? (choose 2)
1. Bucket names must be unique regionally
2. Buckets are replicated globally
3. Bucket names must be unique globally
4. Buckets are region-specific
5. Buckets can contain other buckets

Answer: 3,4

Explanation:
S3 uses a universal (global) namespace, which means bucket names must be unique globally.
However, you create the buckets in a region and the data never leaves that region unless
explicitly configured to do so through cross-region replication (CRR)
Objects within a bucket are replicated within a region across multiple AZs (except for the
One-Zone IA class)
You cannot create nested buckets

Question 18
Which AWS storage technology can be considered a "virtual hard disk in the cloud"?
1. Amazon Elastic File Storage (EFS) filesystem
2. Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume
3. Amazon S3 object
4. Amazon Glacier archive

Answer: 2
Explanation:
An EBS volume is a block storage device that is most similar to a virtual hard disk in the
cloud as when attached to an instance it appears as a local disk that can have an operating
system installed on or be formatted and used for any other local storage purpose
An EFS filesystem is mounted over the NFS protocol which is a file-level protocol.
Therefore, it is a network filesystem not a virtual hard disk and cannot have an operating
system installed or be formatted and used as a locally attached disk
S3 is an object storage system and cannot be mounted and used as a virtual hard drive
Glacier is an archiving solution where you can archive your S3 objects at extremely low cost

Question 21
The IAM service can be used to manage which objects? (choose 2)
1. Security groups
2. Access policies
3. Roles
4. Network ACLs
5. Key pairs

Answer: 2,3
Explanation:
Access policies are objects that you attach to entities and resources to define their
permissions
Roles are created and then “assumed” by trusted entities and define a set of permissions for
making AWS service requests
Security groups and network ACLs are used as instance-level and subnet-level firewalls
respectively
Key pairs are created in EC2 and are used to login to EC2 instances. Don't confuse these with
access keys and secret IDs which are used to grant programmatic access to resources

Question 35
What architectural best practice aims to reduce the interdependencies between services?
1. Services, Not Servers
2. Removing Single Points of Failure
3. Automation
4. Loose Coupling

Answer: 4
Explanation:
As application complexity increases, a desirable attribute of an IT system is that it can be
broken into smaller, loosely coupled components. This means that IT systems should be
designed in a way that reduces interdependencies—a change or a failure in one component
should not cascade to other components
The concept of loos coupling includes "well-defined interfaces" which reduce
interdependencies in a system by enabling interaction only through specific, technologyagnostic interfaces (e.g. RESTful APIs)

Spot instances are good for short term requirements as they can be very economical.
Sometimes AWS may terminate your instance, e.g. when the market price exceeds your bid
price. This is a good option for non-critical workloads that can be terminated
On-Demand is not the most economical option
Reserved instances are good for long-term, static requirements as you must lock-in for 1 or 3
years in return for a decent discount
Dedicated hosts provide a full server dedicated to a single customer and is therefore
expensive

Question 57
What are two ways that moving to an AWS cloud can benefit an organization? (choose 2)
1. Switch to a CAPEX model
2. Increase speed and agility
3. Stop guessing about capacity
4. Depreciate assets over a longer timeframe
5. Gain greater control of data center security

Answer: 2,3

Explanation:
Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision
prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources
or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can
access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only
a few minutes’ notice
In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that
you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just
minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and
time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower
Cloud is based on an operational expenditure (OPEX) model, not a capital expenditure
(CAPEX) model
Cloud does not provide the ability to depreciate assets over a longer timeframe as you
generally do not own the assets
Though the AWS cloud does provide significant security standards for the data center, you do
not get more control as this is an AWS responsibility

- Stored Volume mode – the entire dataset is stored on-site and is asynchronously backed up
to S3 (EBS point-in-time snapshots). Snapshots are incremental and compressed
- Cached Volume mode – the entire dataset is stored on S3 and a cache of the most frequently
accessed data is cached on-site
AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway provides a virtual on-premises file server, which
enables you to store and retrieve files as objects in Amazon S3
Multi-part upload and transfer acceleration are features of S3 associated with uploading files
directly to S3

practices, and tools from software development to make your whole infrastructure reusable,
maintainable, extensible, and testable
With bootstrapping you can execute automated actions to modify default configurations. This
includes scripts that install software or copy data to bring that resource to a particular state
Snapshotting is about saving data, not instantiating resources. Fault tolerance is a method of
increasing the availability of your system when components fail. Performance monitoring has
nothing to do with instantiating resources

Question 61
A company would like to maximize their potential volume and RI discounts across multiple accounts
and also apply service control policies on member accounts. What can they use gain these benefits?
1. AWS Budgets
2. AWS Cost Explorer
3. AWS IAM
4. AWS Organizations

Answer: 4
Explanation:
AWS Organizations enables you to create groups of AWS accounts and then centrally manage
policies across those accounts. AWS Organizations provides consolidated billing in both
feature sets, which allows you set up a single payment method in the organization’s master
account and still receive an invoice for individual activity in each member account. Volume
pricing discounts can be applied to resources
AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or
usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services
and resources securely
The AWS Cost Explorer is a free tool that allows you to view charts of your costs

objects, people, text, scenes, and activities, as well as detect any inappropriate content
Amazon Comprehend identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people,
brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using
tokenization and parts of speech; and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic

Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for
developers to add speech-to-text capability to their applications
AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters
to you. It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select

Question 65
Which type of cloud deployment enables customers to leverage the benefits of the public cloud and
co-existing with on-premises infrastructure?
1. Public Cloud
2. Private Cloud
3. Hybrid Cloud
4. Legacy IT Infrastructure

Answer: 3
Explanation:
A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based
resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method
of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend,
and grow, an organization’s infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to
the internal system
A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in
the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been
migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing
The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management
tools, is sometimes called the “private cloud.” On-premises deployment doesn’t provide
many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide
dedicated resources
Legacy IT infrastructure is not a cloud model. Typically, this includes systems that either not
virtualized or do not have a cloud management layer

Question 3
Which items should be included in a TCO analysis comparing on-premise to AWS Cloud? (choose 2)
1. Firewall management
2. Application licensing
3. Compute hardware
4. Data center security
5. Operating system patching

Answer: 3,4
Explanation:
You need to identify the items that have a cost on-premise and that will be rolled into the
service in the cloud. Compute hardware costs and data center security costs will be rolled in
the service cost in the cloud so you need to include them in the model so you can really
understand the true TCO on-premise vs. the cloud
Firewall management, application licensing and operating system patching need to be paid for
on-premise and in the cloud so there is little difference

Question 8
Which configuration changes are associated with scaling vertically? (choose 2)
1. Adding additional EC2 instances through Auto Scaling
2. Adding additional hard drives to a storage array
3. Adding a larger capacity hard drive to a server
4. Distributed processing
5. Changing an EC2 instance to a type that has more CPU and RAM

Answer: 3,5
Explanation:
Scaling vertically takes place through an increase in the specifications of an individual
resource (e.g., upgrading a server with a larger hard drive or a faster CPU). On Amazon EC2,
this can easily be achieved by stopping an instance and resizing it to an instance type that has
more RAM, CPU, IO, or networking capabilities
Scaling horizontally takes place through an increase in the number of resources (e.g., adding
more hard drives to a storage array or adding more servers to support an application)

2. Use more power efficient instance types
3. Reserve capacity where suitable
4. Be efficient with usage of Security Groups
5. Reduce the amount of data ingress charges

Answer: 1,3
Explanation:
Turning of resources that are not used can reduce spend. You can also use reserved instances
to reduce the monthly spend at the expense of having to lock into a 1 or 3-year contract - good
for stable workloads
You don't pay for power, security groups, or data ingress to the AWS cloud so these answers
are all incorrect

Question 10
Which Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance type enables you to match your capacity reservation to
predictable recurring dates and times?
1. Standard RI
2. Convertible RI
3. Scheduled RI
4. Customized RI

Answer: 3
Explanation:
With RIs, you can choose the type that best fits your applications needs.
Standard RIs: These provide the most significant discount (up to 75% off On-Demand) and
are best suited for steady-state usage
Convertible RIs: These provide a discount (up to 54% off On-Demand) and the capability to
change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved
Instances of equal or greater value. Like Standard RIs, Convertible RIs are best suited for
steady-state usage
Scheduled RIs: These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This
option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that
only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month

Which information security standard applies to entities that store, process or transmit credit
cardholder data?
1. ISO 27001

2. HIPAA
3. NIST
4. PCI DSS

Answer: 4
Explanation:
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information
security standard administered by the PCI Security Standards Council
AWS enables covered entities and their business associates subject to the U.S. Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to use the secure AWS
environment to process, maintain, and store protected health information
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 security controls are
generally applicable to US Federal Information Systems
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is a security management standard that specifies security management

Question 16
What are the advantages of Availability Zones? (choose 2)
1. They allow regional disaster recovery
2. They provide fault isolation
3. They enable the caching of data for faster delivery to end users
4. They are connected by low-latency network connections
5. They enable you to connect your on-premises networks to AWS to form a hybrid cloud

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
Each AWS region contains multiple distinct locations called Availability Zones (AZs). Each
AZ is engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs. An AZ is a data center, and in
some cases, an AZ consists of multiple data centers. AZs within a region provide

inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other zones in the same region. This allows
you to replicate your data across data centers in a synchronous manner so that failover can be
automated and be transparent for your users
An AZ enables fault tolerance and high availability for your applications within a region not
across regions
CloudFront is the technology that is used to enable caching of data for faster delivery to end
users
Direct Connect is the technology that is used to connect your on-premises network to AWS to
form a hybrid cloud

Question 18
Which of the below AWS services supports automated backups as a default configuration?
1. Amazon S3
2. Amazon RDS
3. Amazon EC2
4. Amazon EBS

Answer: 2
Explanation:
RDS automated backups allow point in time recovery to any point within the retention period
down to a second. When automated backups are turned on for your DB Instance, Amazon RDS
automatically performs a full daily snapshot of your data (during your preferred backup
window) and captures transaction logs (as updates to your DB Instance are made). Automated
backups are enabled by default and data is stored on S3 and is equal to the size of the DB
EC2 instances using EBS volumes can be backed up by creating a snapshot of the EBS
volume
Amazon S3 objects are replicated across multiple facilities. You can also archive data onto
Amazon Glacier and use versioning to maintain copies of older versions of objects
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/awsdatabases/
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architectassociate/database/amazon-rds/

Question 19
How can you ensure that the EBS volumes attached to an EC2 instance are still available after the
instance is terminated?
1. EBS volumes automatically persist after the EC2 instance is terminated
2. EBS volumes are always deleted when an EC2 instance is terminated
3. Ensure the “DeleteOnTermination” attribute of the EBS volume is set to false while launching
the instance
4. Take a snapshot of the EBS volume

Answer: 3
Explanation:

Root EBS volumes are deleted on termination by default
Extra non-boot volumes are not deleted on termination by default
The behavior can be changed by altering the “DeleteOnTermination” attribute

Question 20
Which EC2 tenancy model gives you visibility and control over how instances are placed on a
server?
1. Dedicated Instances
2. Dedicated Hosts
3. Dedicated Tenancy
4. Dedicated EC2

Answer: 2
Explanation:
A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use. With a Dedicated
Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server
Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on
hardware that's dedicated to a single customer
Dedicated tenancy ensures all EC2 instances that are launched in a VPC run on hardware
that's dedicated to a single customer
Dedicated EC2 is not an available tenancy model

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html

Question 21
How does the consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations treat Reserved Instances that were
purchased by another account in the organization?
1. All accounts in the organization are treated as one account so any account can receive the
hourly cost benefit
2. Only the master account can benefit from the hourly cost benefit of the reserved instances

3. All accounts in the organization are treated as one account for volume discounts but not for
reserved instances
4. AWS Organizations does not support any volume or reserved instance benefits across
accounts, it is just a method of aggregating bills

Answer: 1
Explanation:
For billing purposes, the consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations treats all the
accounts in the organization as one account. This means that all accounts in the organization
can receive the hourly cost benefit of Reserved Instances that are purchased by any other
account
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ri-behavior.html

Question 22
What is the best way to apply an organizational system to EC2 instances so they can be identified by
descriptors such as purpose or department?
1. Use descriptive hostnames
2. Organize the instances into separate subnets
3. Apply tags
4. Use the instance meta-data

Answer: 3
Explanation:
To help you manage your instances, images, and other Amazon EC2 resources, you can
optionally assign your own metadata to each resource in the form of A tag is a label that you
assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which
you define. Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example,
by purpose, owner, or environment
Using descriptive hostnames or organizing instances into separate subnets is a messy way to
try and organize resources and lacks the power and flexibility of tagging
Storing information in instance meta-data is possible but you need to retrieve the information,
tags enable you to do this more easily
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html

Question 23
Which services provide protection measures against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks?
(choose 2)
1. AWS CloudHSM
2. Amazon CloudFront
3. AWS WAF
4. Internet Gateway
5. Managed VPN

Answer: 2,3
Explanation:
AWS offers globally distributed, high network bandwidth and resilient services that, when
used in conjunction with application-specific strategies, are key to mitigating DDoS attacks
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common
web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume
excessive resources
Amazon CloudFront distributes traffic across multiple edge locations and filters requests to
ensure that only valid HTTP(S) requests will be forwarded to backend hosts. CloudFront also
supports geo-blocking, which you can use to prevent requests from particular geographic
locations from being served
Internet Gateways, Managed VPN and CloudHSM do not help to mitigate DDoS attacks

Question 26
Which descriptions are correct regarding cloud deployment models? (choose 2)
1. With the public cloud the consumer organization typically owns and manages the
infrastructure
2. With the private cloud the consumer organization typically incurs OPEX costs for usage
3. With the hybrid cloud, multiple private clouds are connected
4. With the public cloud the consumer organization typically incurs OPEX costs for usage
5. With the private cloud the consumer organization typically owns and manages the
infrastructure

Answer: 4,5
Explanation:
With public cloud the consumer organization typically incurs OPEX costs as they do not own
the infrastructure and just pay usage costs
With the private cloud the consumer organization typically owns the infrastructure and will
often manage it themselves or use a third-party organization to manage it for them. This model
is largely CAPEX driven
Hybrid clouds are created when you connect private and public clouds together

Question 27
When using Amazon IAM, what authentication methods are available to use? (choose 2)
1. Client certificates
2. Access keys
3. Amazon KMS
4. Server certificates
5. AES 256

Answer: 2,4

Explanation:
Supported authentication methods include console passwords, access keys and server
certificates
Access keys are a combination of an access key ID and a secret access key and can be used to
make programmatic calls to AWS
Server certificates are SSL/TLS certificates that you can use to authenticate with some AWS
services
Client certificates are not a valid IAM authentication method
Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is used for managing encryption keys and is not
used for authentication
AES 256 is an encryption algorithm, not an authentication method
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/identityand-access-management/

Question 28
To ensure the security of your AWS account, what are two AWS best practices for managing access
keys? (choose 2)
1. Don’t create any access keys, use IAM roles instead
2. Don’t generate an access key for the root account user
3. Where possible, use IAM roles with temporary security credentials
4. Rotate access keys daily
5. Use MFA for access keys

Answer: 2,3
Explanation:
Best practices include:
- Don’t generate an access key for the root account user
- Use Temporary Security Credentials (IAM Roles) Instead of Long-Term Access Keys
- Manage IAM User Access Keys Properly
Rotating access keys is a recommended practice, but doing it daily would be excessive and
hard to manage
You can use MFA for securing privileged accounts, but it does not secure access keys
You should use IAM roles where possible, but AWS do not recommend that you don't create
any access keys as they also have a purpose

snapshots?
1. Use S3 lifecycle policies
2. Create a script
3. Create a CloudFormation template
4. Use Amazon DLM

Answer: 4
Explanation:
You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation,
retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes
S3 lifecycle policies apply to data in S3 buckets only, not to EBS volumes
You could write a script but this is not the best method when you have an AWS feature
available that performs the exact functions you need
CloudFormation is typically used for deploying and updating resource configurations rather
than for performing operational activities

References:

Question 35
Which of the following statements are correct regarding Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)? (choose
2)
1. Additional ENIs can be detached from an instance and attached to another instance
2. The primary ENI is identified as "eth0"
3. The primary ENI can be detached from an instance and attached to another instance
4. The attributes of an ENI do not follow it when moved between instances
5. The primary ENI is identified as "eth1"

Answer: 1,2
Explanation:
An elastic network interface (referred to as a network interface in this documentation) is a
logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and
attach it to another instance. The attributes of a network interface follow it as it's attached or
detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. When you move a network
interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance
Every instance in a VPC has a default network interface, called the primary network
interface (eth0). You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. You can
create and attach additional network interfaces

Question 38
Which feature of Amazon S3 adds a layer of additional security to prevent accidental deletion?
1. Versioning
2. Encryption

3. MFA delete
4. Lifecycle management

Answer: 3
Explanation:
MFA delete adds an additional layer of security as users must include the x-amz-mfarequest
header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of
the bucket. This header must include the authentication code from a multi-factor authentication
device
Versioning helps to mitigate the impact of deleting objects as older versions are retained
however it does not prevent deletion
Encryption protects against unauthorized agents reading your data, it does not protect it from
deletion
Lifecycle management can also reduce the impact of deleting objects as they may have been
archived, but again it does not stop you from deleting them
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html

1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
4. AWS Auto Scaling

Answer: 1
Explanation:
ALB is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced

request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including
microservices and containers. Operating at the individual request level (Layer 7), Application
Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
based on the content of the request
NLB is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required.
Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets
within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of
requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies
CLB provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at
both the request level and connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended for
applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network
AWS Auto Scaling is not a type of ELB

Question 19
Which Amazon EC2 billing option allows gives you low cost, maximum flexibility, no upfront costs
or commitment, and you only pay for what you use?
1. Reserved Instances
2. Spot Instances
3. Dedicated Host
4. On-Demand Instances

Answer: 4
Explanation:
With On-Demand instances you pay for hours used with no commitment. There are no upfront
costs so you have maximum flexibility

Spot instances are used for getting a very low price which you bid on. You lose some
flexibility as you are constrained by market prices and your workloads can be terminated if
the market price exceeds your bid price
Reserved instances are based on a commitment to 1 or 3 years in exchange for a large
discount
Dedicated hosts use physically dedicated EC2 servers to isolate your workloads and are
expensive

3. Instance store volumes can be used with all EC2 instance types whereas EBS cannot
4. EBS volumes are file-level storage devices whereas Instance store volumes are object-based

Answer: 2
Explanation:
EBS-backed means the root volume is an EBS volume and storage is persistent. Instance
store-backed means the root volume is an instance store volume and storage is not persistent
Both EBS and Instance store volumes are block-based storage devices
EBS volumes can be used with all EC2 instance types whereas Instance store volumes are
more limited in compatibility

Question 38
Which AWS service is a data warehouse that uses columnar data storage and is suited to analytic and
reporting workloads against very large data sets?
1. Amazon RDS
2. Amazon RedShift
3. Amazon DynamoDB

4. Amazon Aurora

Answer: 2
Explanation:
A data warehouse is a specialized type of relational database, optimized for analysis and
reporting of large amounts of data. It can be used to combine transactional data from disparate
sources making them available for analysis and decision-making. Amazon Redshift is a
managed data warehouse service that is designed to operate at less than a tenth the cost of
traditional solutions
Amazon Redshift achieves efficient storage and optimum query performance through a
combination of massively parallel processing (MPP), columnar data storage, and targeted
data compression encoding schemes. RedShift is particularly suited to analytic and reporting
workloads against very large data sets
Amazon RDS (and Aurora, which is an RDS DB), is a relational, transactional DB not a data
warehouse
Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL DB used for transactional systems also

Answer: 2
Explanation:
The IAM console provides information about when IAM users and roles last attempted to
access AWS services. This information is called service last accessed data. This data can
help you identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your IAM policies to better
adhere to the principle of "least privilege." That means granting the minimum permissions
required to perform a specific task. You can find the data on the Access Advisor tab in the
IAM console by examining the detail view for any IAM user, group, role, or managed policy
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html

Question 43
How can you enable access to AWS accounts using credentials from an on-premise corporate
directory?
1. SSO using Cognito
2. Federation using IAM
3. Replication using Simple AD

4. AWS Organizations

Answer: 2
Explanation:
You can enable single sign-on (SSO) to your AWS accounts by using federation and AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM). By federating your AWS accounts, users can sign in
to the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) using credentials
from your corporate directory
Amazon Cognito helps you add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and web apps easily,
it is not used for connecting corporate directories
Simple AD is an inexpensive Active Directory-compatible service with common directory
features. It is a standalone directory on AWS and cannot replicate with an on-premise
directory
AWS Organizations offers policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. With
Organizations, you can create groups of accounts, automate account creation, apply and
manage policies for those group. It is not used for SSO

Question 48
An organization has multiple AWS accounts and uses a mixture of on-demand and reserved instances.
One account has a considerable amount of unused reserved instances. How can the organization
reduce their costs? (choose 2)
1. Redeem their reserved instances
2. Use Spot instances instead
3. Create an AWS Organization configuration linking the accounts
4. Switch to using placement groups

5. Setup consolidated billing between the accounts

Answer: 3,5
Explanation:
AWS organizations allow you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that
you create and centrally manage. Unused reserved instances (RIs) for EC2 are applied across
the group so the organization can utilize their unused reserved instance instead of consuming
on-demand instances which will lower their costs
You cannot redeem your reserved instances. You can sell them on the AWS marketplace
however
Using placement groups will not lower their costs
Spot instance pricing is variable so it is not guaranteed to lower the cost and it is not suitable
for workloads that cannot be unexpectedly terminated by AWS

2. VPC Endpoints
3. Direct Connect
4. IPSec VPN

Answer: 3
Explanation:
AWS Direct Connect is a network service that provides an alternative to using the Internet to
connect a customer’s on premise sites to AWS. Data is transmitted through a private network
connection between AWS and a customer’s datacenter or corporate network. Direct Connect
is high bandwidth, and low latency
The AWS Managed VPN (which is a type of IPSec VPN) is fast to setup but uses the public
Internet and therefore latency is not as good and is unpredictable
VPC endpoint enable private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC
without using an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or

firewall proxies

Question 53

Which security service only requires a rule to be created in one direction as it automatically allows
return traffic?
1. VPC Router
2. Network ACL
3. Security Group
4. AWS Shield

Answer: 3
Explanation:
Security groups are stateful so if you allow traffic to pass through, the return traffic is
automatically allowed even if no rule matches the traffic
Network ACLs are stateless so you must create rules in both directions to allow traffic
through
A VPC router is not a security service

SET 5: PRACTICE QUESTIONS, ANSWERS &
EXPLANATIONS
Question 1
A company wants to utilize a pay as you go cloud model for all of their applications without CAPEX
costs and which is highly elastic. Which cloud delivery model will suit them best?
1. Public
2. Private
3. Hybrid
4. On-premise

Answer: 1
Explanation:
The public cloud is offered under a purely pay as you go model (unless you choose to
reserve), and allows companies to completely avoid CAPEX costs. The public cloud is also
highly elastic so companies can grow and shrink the applications as demand changes
Private and on-premise clouds are essentially the same, though both could be managed by a
third party and even could be delivered under an OPEX model by some vendors. However,
they are typically more CAPEX heavy and the elasticity is limited
A hybrid model combines public and private and this company wants to go all in on a single
model

Question 36
Which AWS IAM best practice recommends applying the minimum permissions necessary to perform
a task when creating IAM policies?
1. Create individual IAM users
2. Use roles to delegate permissions
3. Grant least privilege
4. Enable MFA for privileged users

Answer: 3
Explanation:
When you create IAM policies, follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege
—that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need
to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege

Question 37
In Amazon EC2, which types of Placement Groups are available? (choose 2)
1. Cluster
2. Affinity
3. Proximity
4. Spread
5. Zone

Answer: 1,4
Explanation:
Placement groups are a logical grouping of instances in one of the following configurations:
- A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability
Zone. Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low
network latency, high network throughput, or both, and if the majority of the network traffic is
between the instances in the group
- A spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying
hardware. Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small
number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architectassociate/compute/amazon-ec2/

Question 38
What are the benefits of using IAM roles for applications that run on EC2 instances? (choose 2)
1. Easier to configure than using storing access keys within the EC2 instance
2. More secure than storing access keys within applications
3. Can apply multiple roles to a single instance
4. It is easier to manage IAM roles
5. Role credentials are permanent

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
Using IAM roles instead of storing credentials within EC2 instances is more secure It is also

easier to manage roles
It is not easier to configure as there are extra steps that need to be completed
You cannot apply multiple roles to a single instance
Role credentials are temporary, not permanent, and are rotated automatically
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html

Question 39
With which service can a developer upload code from a Git repository and have the service handle
the end-to-end deployment of the resources?
1. AWS CodeDeploy
2. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
3. Amazon ECS
4. AWS CodeCommit

Answer: 2
Explanation:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk can be used to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS
Cloud. Developers upload applications and Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment details
of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring
AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based
repositories
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software
deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and your
on-premises servers
Amazon Elastic Container Service is a managed service for running Docker containers
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architectassociate/compute/aws-elastic-beanstalk/

Question 40
Which service can you use to monitor, store and access log files generated by EC2 instances and onpremises servers?
1. Amazon CloudTrail
2. AWS OpsWorks

3. Amazon CloudWatch Logs
4. Amazon Kinesis

Answer: 3
Explanation:
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and
other sources
You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs
Amazon CloudTrail is used for recording a history of API actions taken on your account.
Amazon Kinesis is a set of services used for collecting, processing and analyzing streaming
data

of as little as 5 minutes?
1. Snapshot backup
2. Full backup
3. Incremental backup
4. Point-in-time recovery

Answer: 4
Explanation:
You can restore a DB instance to a specific point in time with a granularity of 5 minutes. RDS
uses transaction logs which it uploads to Amazon S3 to do this
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html

Question 42
Which combination of AWS services could be used to deploy a stateless web application that can
automatically and elastically scale?
1. EC2, Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing

2. EC2, CloudFront and RDS
3. EC2, DynamoDB and ElastiCache
4. EC2, EBS and Auto Scaling

Answer: 1
Explanation:
Whenever EC2 is included you need to use Auto Scaling to automatically scale the number of
instances which only leaves 2 potential answers. EBS volumes can only be mounted to a
single instance and so data cannot be shared therefore that rules out the other potential answer.
Therefore, EC2 with Auto Scaling and an ELB sitting in front is the correct solution
DynamoDB can be used for storing session state for stateless web applications but is not
necessary for the answer
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/awscompute/

performance improvements?
1. Amazon ElastiCache
2. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
3. Amazon EFS
4. Amazon CloudFront

Answer: 2
Explanation:
Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory
cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement – from milliseconds
to microseconds – even at millions of requests per second
DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB
tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster
management

Question 44
A developer needs a way to automatically provision a collection of AWS resources. Which AWS
service is primarily used for deploying infrastructure as code?
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
2. Amazon CloudFormation
3. AWS CodeDeploy
4. Jenkins

Answer: 2
Explanation:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create
a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable
fashion. AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and
provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. Think of CloudFormation
as deploying infrastructure as code
Elastic Beanstalk is more focussed on deploying applications on EC2 (PaaS)
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software
deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and your
on-premises servers
Jenkins deploys infrastructure as code but is not an AWS service

1. Amazon Route 53 is an internal elastic load balancer
2. You can register domain names via Amazon Route 53
3. Amazon Route 53 does not support SPF records
4. Amazon Route 53 supports Alias and CNAME records
5. Amazon Route 53 can be used to connect on-premises data centers to the AWS cloud

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service
Route 53 offers the following functions:
- Domain name registry
- DNS resolution
- Health checking of resources
Health checks verify Internet connected resources are reachable, available and functional
Routing policies include Simple, Weighted, Latency-based, Failover and Geo-Location
Many record types are supported including Alias and CNAME
Internal elastic load balancing is performed by the Amazon ELB
It does not support connecting on-premises data centers to the cloud - this is done by Direct
Connect

Question 46
Assuming you have configured them correctly, which AWS services can scale automatically without
intervention? (choose 2)
1. Amazon RDS
2. Amazon EC2
3. Amazon S3
4. Amazon DynamoDB
5. Amazon EBS

Answer: 3,4
Explanation:
Both S3 and DynamoDB automatically scale as demand dictates. In the case of DynamoDB
you can either configure the on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. With on-demand
capacity mode DynamoDB automatically adjusts the read and write throughput for you
EC2 cannot scale automatically. You need to use Auto Scaling to scale the number of EC2
instances deployed
EBS and RDS do not scale automatically. You must intervene to adjust volume sizes and
database instance types to scale these resources

https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architectassociate/storage/amazon-s3/

Question 47
To reward customers for using their services, what are two ways AWS reduce prices? (choose 2)
1. Volume based discounts when you use more services
2. Reduction in inbound data transfer charges
3. Reduced cost for reserved capacity
4. Discounts for using a wider variety of services
5. Removal of termination fees for customers who spend more

Answer: 1,3
Explanation:
AWS provide volume based discount so that when you use more services you reduce the cost
per service. You can also reserve capacity by locking in to fixed 1 or 3 year contracts to get
significant discounts
You never pay for inbound data transfer
You don't get discounts for using a variety of services, only when you use more services
There are never termination fees with AWS

Question 48
How can a company connect from their on-premises network to VPCs in multiple regions using
private connections?
1. AWS Managed VPN
2. AWS Direct Connect Gateway
3. Amazon CloudFront
4. Inter-Region VPC Peering

Answer: 2
Explanation:
You can use an AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection
over a private virtual interface to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in the
same or different Regions
AWS Managed VPN uses the public Internet and is therefore not a private connection
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network used for caching data
Inter-Region VPC peering does not help you to connect from an on-premise network
References:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways.html

Question 49
Which AWS components aid in the construction of fault-tolerant applications? (choose 2)
1. Elastic IP addresses
2. ARNs
3. AMIs
4. Tags
5. Block device mappings

Answer: 1,3
Explanation:
Elastic IP addresses can be easily remapped between EC2 instances in the event of a failure.
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) can be used to quickly launch replacement instances when
there is a failure
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), tags and block device mappings don't really help with
fault tolerance
References:
https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/designing-fault-tolerant-applications/

Question 51
Which of the following are advantages of using the AWS cloud computing over legacy IT? (choose 2)
1. You are able to pass responsibility for the availability of your application to AWS
2. You don't need to worry about over provisioning as you can elastically scale
3. You don't need to patch your operating systems
4. You can bring new applications to market faster
5. You can bring services closer to your end users

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
With cloud computing you no longer need to guess about capacity as you can elastically scale.
This means you don't end up overprovisioning but instead react to the load on your servers.
You can also be faster and more agile with development and release of applications
You do not pass responsibility for your application to AWS. AWS runs the infrastructure but
you still manage the application
You still need to patch your own operating systems
The cloud is centralized so you won't necessarily bring services closer to your end users
References:

https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/cloudcomputing-concepts/

Question 52
Which type of Amazon EBS volume do AWS suggest customers use for the boot volume of most
workloads?
1. General Purpose SSD
2. Provisioned IOPS SSD
3. Throughput Optimized HDD
4. Cold HDD

Answer: 1
Explanation:
AWS suggest that the General Purpose SSD is used for the boot volume of most workloads
Provisioned IOPS SSD is for high performance applications that require sustained IOPS
Throughput Optimized HDD is for streaming workloads with fast throughput requirements
Cold HDD is the lowest cost HDD and is for infrequently accessed data
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/awsstorage/

Question 53
What charges are applicable to Amazon S3 Standard storage class? (choose 2)
1. Per GB/month storage fee
2. Retrieval fee
3. Minimum capacity charge per object
4. Data ingress
5. Data egress

Answer: 1,5
Explanation:
With the standard storage class, you pay a per GB/month storage fee, and data transfer out of
S3

Standard-IA and One Zone-IA have a minimum capacity charge per object
Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, and Glacier also have a retrieval fee
You don't pay for data into S3 under any storage class

https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architectassociate/storage/amazon-s3/

Question 54
An engineer launched a new EC2 instance and it was immediately terminated. What is the most likely
reason?
1. The user does not have the permissions to launch EC2 instances
2. The AZ does not have any capacity left
3. The account has reached its On-Demand instance limit for the region
4. The AMI was deleted

Answer: 3
Explanation:
You are limited to running up to a total of 20 On-Demand instances across the instance family,
purchasing 20 Reserved Instances, and requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit
per region
If a user did not have permissions to launch an instance then it would not launch at all, rather
than launching and then terminating
If the AZ did not have capacity, or the AMI was deleted the instance would not launch

Question 55
How can a company connect their EC2 instances in one region with EC2 instances in another region
using private IP addresses?
1. Inter-Region VPC Peering
2. AWS Direct Connect
3. AWS Managed VPN
4. VPC Peering

Answer: 1
Explanation:
Amazon EC2 now allows peering relationships to be established between Virtual Private
Clouds (VPCs) across different AWS regions. Inter-Region VPC Peering allows VPC
resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases and Lambda functions running in different AWS
regions to communicate with each other using private IP addresses, without requiring
gateways, VPN connections or separate network appliances
VPC Peering is used to peer VPCs within the same region
AWS Direct Connect is a private connection from an on-premise network to an AWS region, it
does not enable connectivity between regions (unless you use Direct Connect Gateway)
References:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/announcing-support-for-inter-regionvpc-peering/

Question 56
Which of the following descriptions is incorrect in relation to the design of Availability Zones?
1. AZ’s have direct, low-latency, high throughput and redundant network connections between
each other
2. Each AZ is designed as an independent failure zone
3. AZs are physically separated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower
risk flood plains
4. Each subnet in a VPC is mapped to all AZs in the region

Answer: 4
Explanation:
Subnets are created within a single AZ and do not get mapped to multiple AZs
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/awsglobal-infrastructure/
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/awsnetworking/

Question 58
When designing a VPC, what is the purpose of an Internet Gateway?
1. Provides Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets
2. Enables Internet communications for instances in public subnets
3. It's a bastion host for inbound management connections
4. It's used for making VPN connections to a VPC

Answer: 2
Explanation:
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component
that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It therefore
imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic
An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for
internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that
have been assigned public IPv4 addresses
You cannot use an Internet Gateway as a bastion host, deploy an EC2 instance in a public
subnet for this purpose
You cannot connect instances in a private subnet to the Internet using an Internet Gateway, you

need a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for this purpose
You cannot use the Internet Gateway for making VPN connections to a VPC, you need a
Virtual Private Gateway for this purpose

Question 60
Which of the following configuration items are important to enabling an EC2 web server to serve

web pages on the Internet? (choose 2)
1. Security group rules configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS
2. A private IP address assigned to the instance
3. Security groups rules configured to allow SSH
4. A public IP address assigned to the instance
5. An established VPN connection

Answer: 1,4
Explanation:
To connect to a web page on a web server you use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. You therefore
need to ensure the instance's security group allows these protocols in an inbound rule
A public IP address assigned to an instance in a public subnet is required in order to be able
to directly access the instance from the Internet. There also needs to be an Internet Gateway
attached to the VPC and an entry in the route table for the subnet that points to it
A private IP address will always be assigned to instances in EC2, but these do not enable
access from the Internet
An established VPN connection is not required, connections will come through an Internet
Gateway to a public subnet

https://digitalcloud.training/2018/10/19/cloud-computing-basics-compute/

Question 61
How can a company protect their Amazon S3 data from a regional disaster?
1. Archive to Amazon Glacier
2. Use Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to copy to another region
3. Use lifecycle actions to move to another S3 storage class
4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) delete

Answer: 2
Explanation:
The only option here that will help is to use CRR to copy the data to another region. This will
provide disaster recovery
Moving to Glacier or another S3 storage class does not copy the data out of the region
Enabling MFA delete will not protect the data from a regional disaster

Question 63
How do AWS charge for Amazon CloudFront? (choose 2)
1. Data transfer out
2. Data transfer in
3. Number of requests
4. Number of users
5. Uptime

Answer: 1,3
Explanation:

Question 64
Which AWS service is part of the suite of "serverless" services and runs code as functions?
1. Amazon ECS
2. Amazon EKS
3. AWS Lambda
4. AWS CodeCommit

Answer: 3
Explanation:
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and
automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. The code you run on AWS
Lambda is called a “Lambda function”
Amazon ECS and EKS are both used for running software containers such as Docker
containers
AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based
repositories

How do AWS charge for the use of NAT Gateways? (choose 2)
1. Price per gateway hour
2. Price per port
3. Price per GB processed
4. Price per instance session
5. Price per protocol

Answer: 1,3
Explanation:
If you choose to create a NAT gateway in your VPC, you are charged for each “NAT
Gateway-hour" that your NAT gateway is provisioned and available. Data processing charges
apply for each Gigabyte processed through the NAT gateway regardless of the traffic’s source
or destination

Question 1
What type of cloud computing service type do AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon RDS correspond
to?
1. IaaS
2. PaaS
3. SaaS
4. Hybrid

Answer: 2
Explanation:
Both Elastic Beanstalk and RDS are services that are managed at the platform level meaning
you don't need to manage the infrastructure level yourself. Therefore, tasks like OS
management and patching are performed for you
IaaS is a model where the underlying hardware platform and hypervisor are managed for you
and you are delivered tools and interfaces for working with operating system instances
SaaS is a model where the whole stack is managed for you right up to the application and you
are delivered working software that you can customize and populate with data
Hybrid is a type of cloud delivery model in which you consume both public and private cloud
and connect the two together

Question 4
How can a company configure automatic, asynchronous copying of objects in Amazon S3 buckets
across regions?
1. This is done by default by AWS
2. By configuring multi-master replication
3. Using cross-region replication

4. Using lifecycle actions

Answer: 3
Explanation:
Cross-region replication (CRR) enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across
buckets in different AWS Regions. Buckets configured for cross-region replication can be
owned by the same AWS account or by different account
Multi-master replication is not something you can do with Amazon S3 (Amazon Aurora has
this feature)
Lifecycle actions cannot be configured to move to another storage class in a different region

2. Using a rule on the Internet Gateway
3. Using a Security Group deny rule
4. Using a Network ACL deny rule
5. Through VPC route table configuration

Answer: 1,4
Explanation:
To block access to a known list of IP addresses you can configure a local firewall on the web
server or use Network ACL deny rules
You cannot create deny rules with Security Groups (only allow rules)
Internet Gateways do not have allow/deny rules and route table configuration could not be
used to break connections with specific addresses
References:

Question 6
How can a Solutions Architect reduce the latency between end-users and applications or content?
(choose 2)
1. Deploy applications in multiple AZs
2. Deploy applications in regions closest to the end-users
3. Use S3 Transfer Acceleration to improve application performance
4. Use Amazon CloudFront to cache content closer to end-users
5. Use larger EC2 instance types for the applications

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
To reduce latency, which corresponds with the distance over which network communications
travel, you should aim to host your applications closer to your end-users. This means
deploying them in the closest regions
Deploying in multiple AZs may create resiliency but won't change latency much as AZs are
geographically close to each other
S3 Transfer Acceleration is used to improve upload speeds for S3 objects and does not affect
application performance
CloudFormation is used for deploying resources through code ("infrastructure as code")
Using a larger instance type for your application may improve application performance but
will not reduce latency

Question 20
Which of the statements below do not characterize cloud computing?
1. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power
2. With cloud computing you get to benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Cloud computing allows you to swap variable expense for capital expense
4. With cloud computing you can increase your speed and agility

Answer: 3
Explanation:
Cloud computing is not a one-off capital expense, it is an ongoing operating expense. The
caveat to this is that if you purchase reserved capacity you have an option to partially or fully
pay upfront. however, it is still an operating cost as you do not own and depreciate the assets
References:
https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/cloudcomputing-concepts/

Question 21
What are the advantages of running a database service such as Amazon RDS in the cloud versus
deploying on-premise? (choose 2)
1. You have full control of the operating system and can install your own operational tools
2. Scalability is improved as it is quicker to implement and there is an abundance of capacity
3. You can use any database software you like, allowing greater flexibility
4. High availability is easier to implement due to built-in functionality for deploying read
replicas and multi-AZ
5. There are no costs for replicating data between DBs in different data centers or regions

Answer: 2,4
Explanation:
The advantages of using Amazon RDS include being able to easily scale by increasing your
instance type without having to go through a long procurement cycle for getting new hardware
or worrying about whether capacity exists on your existing private cloud infrastructure. You
can also implement fault tolerance and scalability features through multi-AZ and read replicas
easily
With Amazon RDS you do not have control of the operating system and you cannot use any
database software you like as you are restricted to a list of several engines. There are costs
for replicating data between AZs and regions so this must be taken into account in any cost
analysis

on the AWS cloud. Which AWS service can be used to connect their on-premise AD to AWS?
1. Simple AD
2. AD Connector
3. IAM Connector

4. RADIUS

Answer: 2
Explanation:
AD Connector is a directory gateway for redirecting directory requests to your on-premise
Active Directory. AD Connector eliminates the need for directory synchronization and the
cost and complexity of hosting a federation infrastructure. Connects your existing on-premise
AD to AWS
Simple AD is an inexpensive Active Directory-compatible service with common directory
features. It is a standalone, fully managed directory in the AWS cloud. It does not connect your
on-premise AD to AWS
IAM connector does not exist
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol, operating
on port 1812 that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA
or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service. It is not an AWS
service

Question 35
How can you deploy your EC2 instances so that if a single data center fails you still have instances
available?
1. Across regions
2. Across subnets
3. Across Availability Zones
4. Across VPCs

Answer: 3
Explanation:
An AZ spans one or more data centers and each AZ is physically isolated from other AZs and
connected by high speed networking. If you want to deploy a highly available application you
should spread your instances across AZs and they will be resilient to the failure of a single
DC
Subnets are created within AZs. Therefore, if you deploy resources into multiple subnets
within an AZ and a data center fails, you may lose all of your instances
You could deploy your instances across separate regions but this is not necessary to create a
highly available application and introduces complexity and cost. For example, you may need
multiple ELBs (one per region), complex name resolution and potential data transfer charges

Question 37
How can a systems administrator specify a script to be run on an EC2 instance during launch?
1. Metadata
2. User Data
3. Run Command
4. AWS Config

Answer: 2
Explanation:
When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you have the option of passing user data to the
instance that can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run
scripts after the instance starts
You can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell scripts and cloud-init directives

User data is data that is supplied by the user at instance launch in the form of a script
User data is limited to 16KB
User data and meta data are not encrypted

Question 38
How can a company facilitate the sharing of data over private connections between two accounts they
own within a region?
1. Create an internal ELB
2. Create a subnet peering connection
3. Create a VPC peering connection
4. Configure matching CIDR address ranges

Answer: 3
Explanation:
A VPC peering connection helps you to facilitate the transfer of data. For example, if you have
more than one AWS account, you can peer the VPCs across those accounts to create a file
sharing network. You can also use a VPC peering connection to allow other VPCs to access
resources you have in one of your VPCs
An internal ELB will not help you to transfer data between accounts
You cannot peer subnets
Configuring matching CIDR address ranges will not mean you can route between accounts.
Also, you cannot peer with an account with a matching (or overlapping) address range

Question 47
What do you need to create to specify how your AWS Auto Scaling Group scales and shrinks?
1. IAM Policy
2. Scaling Plan
3. Scaling Policy
4. Launch Configuration

Answer: 3
Explanation:
Scaling policies determine when, if, and how the ASG scales and shrinks (ondemand/dynamic scaling, cyclic/scheduled scaling)
Scaling Plans define the triggers and when instances should be provisioned/de-provisioned
A launch configuration is the template used to create new EC2 instances and includes
parameters such as instance family, instance type, AMI, key pair and security groups
An IAM policy is not used to control Auto Scaling
